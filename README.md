# Heal-MusicPlayer-Sorter
This is a project I've done in the beginning of 2018 for myself. I considered that I should share my work with other people. So here it is, a generalised version of it.

++ Help Section:<br>
    The list of songs is updated each time the file is loaded, that includes deleting info about songs that don't exist anymore.<br>
    Songs are searched only in C:\Users\{username}\Music for now.<br>
    The Search and Edit buttons on the bottom right side work along with tag buttons. The text box works along with the top buttons.<br>
    After you press the "Bands" button you can double click a band to display all the songs you have from it.<br>
    The app follows this syntax to get the bands: <<MyBand - Title>><br>
    If you want to edit the tags and the scores, head to Repository for Tags(Categories) and Controller for Scores.<br>

This wasn't meant to be an actual music player, therefore it cannot loop through songs. I will work on my free time to imrpove this app.

Enjoy :)
